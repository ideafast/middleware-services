# Data Transfer Protocols (DTP)

DTP consists of multiple ETL data workflows for a range of sensing devices as part of the IDEA-FAST project. This involves Extracting data from manufactureâ€™s data portals, Transforming (pre-processing) the data to perform data quality  and assurance checks, and Loading data into an external data portal.
